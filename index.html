        <p class="p">
          If you’re lucky enough to work from home, every day is “Take Your Dog
          to Work Day.” But most people aren’t, so today is the one day <br />
          a year that many companies allow their employees to bring their pups
          with them. Some workplaces are so fantastic that dogs are <br />
          welcome all year round!While it’s obviously not recommended for dogs
          to be brought to work sites that are dangerous for them or <br />
          where they’ll get in the way, such as an operating room or a factory
          floor, offices can be the perfect environment for pets.

            <p>
              Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has filed for a patent for beehive-like
              <br />
              towers that would serve as multi-level fulfillment centers for its
              <br />
              delivery drones to take off and land. The facilities would be
              built <br />
              vertically to blend in with high rises in urban areas. Amazon
              <br />
              envisions each city would have one. The patent application, <br />
              filed in December 2015 and published on Thursday by the U.S.
              <br />
              Patent and Trademark Office, features several drawings of <br />
              these buildings, such as the beehive, a cylinder-shaped center
              <br />
              and one that looks like a UFO

            <p>
              Without a doubt, sushi is one of Japan's greatest gastronomical
              <br />
              gifts to the world. Almost poetic in its simplicity, good sushi
              <br />
              relies on two things: the freshness of the ingredients and the
              <br />
              knife skills of the chef. Whether you like your raw fish draped
              <br />
              over bite-sized balls of vinegared rice, rolled up in toasted nori
              <br />
              seaweed or pressed into fat rectangular logs, delicious sushi
              <br />
              can be found in every price range.The sushi at Sushisho Masa
              <br />
              in Roppongi is nothing short of perfection. At around ¥20,000
              <br />
              ($200) per person, it's a splurge, but perfection doesn't come
              <br />

        <p>
          There's something about being far above the hubbub of the Big Apple's
          streets, especially in the summertime, when humidity levels <br />
          soar and the concrete feels like it's emanating heat waves. "Being on
          a New York City rooftop gives you this special pleasure of feeling
          <br />
          part of the city, inside it, but at a distance," says Ray Chung,
          director of design at The Johnson Studio, the firm behind the rooftop
          <br />
          lounge at The Wit Hotel in Chicago, among other projects."Walking down
          the streets is one thing, but being able to let your guard <br />
          down and see the city reduced in size -- all the while still breathing
          the same air and still hearing the buzz of the city -- it can be
          <br />
          intoxicating," says Chung.

          <h2>The best things to do and see in Newport</h2>
          <p>
            Many of those cliches about postcard-pretty coastal New England
            towns got their start in the same place: Newport, Rhode Island.The
            town is best known for being a summer getaway for America's
            aristocracy during the Gilded Age, with wealthy families like the
            Vanderbilts, the Dukes and Astors all owning summer homes there
            (they say "cottage," we say "ginormous mansion") and throwing
            glamorous parties.Although more of the luxurious estates are museums
            than homes these days, Newport hasn't lost its seaside charm --
            especially in the summer. Here's our guide to the best things to do,
            eat and explore both indoors and out.

              one lone puppy left who had yet to be <br />
              adopted. Not to worry however, that <br />
              puppy too found a great forever home, <br />

              row from a high-kill shelter in the <br />

              the lucky person to adopt that final dog. <br />
              Webb had been in line there for quite <br />

      <h2>What Facebook's new mission can and can't fix</h2>
      <p>
        With nearly 2 billion people around the world checking in monthly, it
        makes sense that Facebook is dealing with some very sticky <br />
        issues. The social network is facing increasing pressure to address them
        head on. He's shifting its focus from connecting individuals to <br />
        building communities, namely by getting people to join more Facebook
        groups.The change is summed up in the company's new <br />
        mission statement: "Give people the power to build community and bring
        the world closer together."But how much of the company's <br />
        problems can really be fixed by the new direction?
